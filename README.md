## How to use

Check out this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/endel/colyseus-babylonjs-boilerplate.git
```

Inside this repository, there's two separate applications. The client (babylonjs + colyseus client) and the server (nodejs + colyseus server).

### Client application

To be able to build the client application, you'll need to enter in the folder,
and install its dependencies first.

```
cd colyseus-babylonjs-boilerplate/client
npm install
```

Now you can build and run it by running:

```
npm start
```

It will spawn the `webpack-dev-server`, listening on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).


### Server application

For the server, the steps are exactly the same. Install the dependencies:

```
cd colyseus-babylonjs-boilerplate/server
npm install
```

Now you can build and run it by running:

```
npm start
```

It will spawn a web socket server, listening on [ws://localhost:2657](ws://localhost:2657).
